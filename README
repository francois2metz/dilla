Dilla is a command that populates your database with randomized data. You'll need install dilla as an app in the django settings file.

Examples:
1. Generate data for all models in an app
   >>python manage.py dilla app_name

2. Generate data for all models in all apps listed
   >>python manage.py dilla app_name app_name

3. Generate data for all models in all apps listed (an alternative to #2)
   >>python manage.py dilla -a app_name -a app_name

4. Generate data for supplied models, in the supplied apps
   >>python manage.py dilla -a app_name -m ModelName

5. Addition to #4, generate data for multiple models
   >>python manage.py dilla -a app_name -m ModelName -m AnotherModelName

** The order of app names and model names are important, if a model has
   a ForeignKey to another model, but there isn't data available yet
   in the foregn table, problems occur.

** When using -a or -m, you don't need to use full python path.
